Overview:

A repository to contain the OpenXT Para-virtual USB Windows front end driver.
This driver along with the Linux front and back end drivers are currently
only in the OpenXT project. Ideally they would supplant the existing version
that lives in the 2.6.x kernels (and is not yet in the 3.x/4.x lines).


Getting:

There are various git tools for Windows. One good choice is Cygwin for a nice
Unixy environment. A simple choice is GIT-SCM:

http://git-scm.com/download/win

Regardless of the tool used, to be able to build the project, two repositories
need to be cloned. First clone:

git://github.com/OpenXT/xc-windows.git

The xc-vusb project depends on header files and libraries in this repo. Then
clone the xc-vusb repo inside the xc-windows.git repo:

git://github.com/OpenXT/xc-vusb.git


Building:

First the xc-windows.git code must be built. This requires installing the
Windows 7 WDK. Once installed use one of the "Longhorn/Vista" build
environments - this opens a command prompt. Choose x86 or x64 (or both)
depending on what sort of xc-vusb driver is to be built. Within
xc-windows.git, run something like:

 build -cbgz

Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (or later) and the Windows 8 (or later) WDK are
required to build the xc-vusb driver. The main project file lives here:

Drivers/xenvusb/xenvusb.sln

There are a number of different build targets to choose from. The binaries end
up here:

Drivers/xenvusb/Win7Release or Win7Debug for 32b
Drivers/xenvusb/x64/Win7Release or Win7Debug for 64b

Manual driver signing can be done using the xc-windows/do_sign.ps1 script but
it is probably easier and saner to follow the build instructions here to get
a proper signed build of the driver:
